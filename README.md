# Thurstan - Simple IOC Scanner based on Loki

Scanner for Simple Indicators of Compromise with client/server Architecture

Detection is based on four detection methods:

    1. File Name IOC
       Regex match on full file path/name

    2. Yara Rule Check
       Yara signature match on file data and process memory

    3. Hash check
       Compares known malicious hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) with scanned files

## How-To Run Thurstan and Analyse the Reports

### Run Server

  - Download the program archive via the button "Download ZIP" on the right sidebar
  - Unpack THURSTAN locally
  - open a command line "cmd.exe" and run server.exe from there

### Run Client

  - Download the program archive via the button "Download ZIP" on the right sidebar
  - Unpack THURSTAN locally
  - Provide the folder to a target system that should be scanned: removable media, network share, folder on target system
  - open a command line "cmd.exe" as Administrator and run thurstan.exe from there with parameter "-x Server-IP" (you can also run LOKI without administrative privileges but some checks will be disabled and relevant objects on disk will not be accessible)

# Antivirus - False Positives

The compiled scanner may be detected by antivirus engines. This is caused by the fact that the scanner is a compiled python script that implement some file system and process scanning features that are also used in compiled malware code.

If you don't trust the compiled executable, please compile it yourself.
